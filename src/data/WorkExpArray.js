          SkogApp AS: Conducted several interviews with potential customers. 
          Successfully built the first MVP (https://app.skogapp.no/). To help foresters 
          earn more out of their forest by optimizing operations, forest inventory, and carbon-crediting.
          Automated the process of creating a forestry plan from 2 years to 30 minutes.
          TAVANA AS: Successfully raised a pre-seed round and built the first MVP. 
          The Product was Automatic medical-coding for healthcare professionals.
          Hired and mentored 5 employees. Built the first medical LLM in Norwegian. 
          Collaborated with Harvard Medical School and MIT to train BERT for medical 
          purposes. Contributed to the open-source AI community by publishing annotated data and LLMs.
          I designed a microservice architecture, using the API gateway, Serverless 
          function, messaging services (Kafka/Redis/SQS), and SQL and NoSQL Databases to 
          achieve a secure scalable web application. For quality and performance optimization, 
          I used the CI/CD practices via GitHub actions, Terraform, and Netlify/AWS Serverless technologies.

        expectations and feelings and give constructive feedback.

        new ideas and diverse ways of doing things. 
        I have regular one-on-one with my team and my manager and constantly ask 
        for their feedback if they expected me to do sth. or if I failed to 
        support them in functioning at their best.

        Daily, I interact with many stakeholders, including product owners,

        The research includes technical scoping, finding logical fallacies in 
        the current processes and architectural designs. I make sure that the 
        future design and the use of third-party services are compatible so that
        the business is not spending lots of money on sth. that would either 
        not work or worsen the customer experience. 
        Parallel to my duties as an architect, I also manage software product 
        implementation from concept to completion, focusing on the quality of 
        our software and the personal development within the team. I participate
        in code review sessions and make sure the code meets the high quality

        (working very closely with DevOps and leading the projects into 
        production (including TDD, BDD, CI/CD with agile methodologies)). 
        On the business side, I've spent a good chunk of my weekly time 
        interacting with stakeholders, product owners, and designers to make 
        sure that the business needs and the requirements are mapped correctly

        the continuous integration and delivery of the product happens 
        efficiently, securely, automatically and meets the highest quality 
        standards. 
        The research was done in various fields, including challenges around 
        the blockchain, cryptography, game-theory and graph-theory, cloud-based 
        micro-services (Azure), security, authentication/authorisation, and 
        automation. Using other DevOps infrastructure as a code framework, e.g.,
        Terraform, Azure ARM and Bitbucket templates, we built, tested, and
